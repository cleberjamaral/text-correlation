Behaviour support agents need to be aware of the social envi-\\nronment of the user in order to be able to provide comprehensive support.\\nHowever, this is a feature that is currently lacking in existing systems.\\nTo tackle it, first of all we explore literature from social sciences in order\\nto find which elements of the social environment need to be represented.\\nWe structure this knowledge as a two-level ontology that models social\\nsituations. It consists of an upper level which contains general elements\\nof social situations, and a lower level which describes domain-specific\\nfeatures. We formalize the elements that are needed to model social sit-\\nuations, which consist of different types of meetings between two people.\\nWe conduct a pilot experiment to evaluate our knowledge structure us-\\ning feedback from the subjects, and to test whether we can use the data\\nto reason about the priority of different situations. Subjects found our\\nproposed features of social relationships to be understandable and rep-\\nresentative. Furthermore, we show these features can be combined in a\\ndecision tree to predict the priority of social situations.\\n\\nKeywords: Socially aware agents \\xc2\\xb7 Social situation modelling \\xc2\\xb7 Knowl-\\nedge representation\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nApplications that help users live healthier lifestyles or form desired habits are\\nspreading rapidly. However, they focus only on modelling the user, and they lack\\nthe tools to model the environment surrounding the user. For instance, an app\\nthat helps its user be more punctual will send reminders at different intervals\\nwhen it sees that a meeting is approaching. However, not all meetings have\\nthe same priority: for most people, being on time for a job interview is more\\nimportant than being on time for an informal dinner with friends. Therefore,\\nhelp has to be situational. Behaviour support agents need information about\\nwhat is going on around the user in order to provide comprehensive support.\\n\\n? This work is part of the research programme CoreSAEP (project no. 639.022.416),\\nsupported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).\\n\\nlouisedennis\\nPlaced Image\\n\\n\\n\\n2 Kola et al.\\n\\nIn this work we focus on modelling the social environment of the user for\\nbehaviour support agents. To do this, we will use the concept of situations.\\nWhat key elements should be modelled and perceived in order to capture the\\nsocial essence of a situation? Our research on social science literature reveals a\\nset of variables for representing the relationship of the user with another person,\\nas well as a set of variables for representing situation cues. We organise this\\ninformation in a two-level ontology: an upper one involving general concepts\\nneeded to model situations, and a lower one with more specific domain-related\\nfeatures. In this work we limit ourselves with offering a set of elements of the\\nenvironment that have to be represented and reason on it, and do not focus on\\nhow this information is acquired.\\n\\nTo evaluate our approach, we conduct a pilot study where subjects provide\\ninformation about their relationship with people in their social circle, and then\\nanswer some questions about potential situations involving these people. These\\nsituations are daily life meetings such as: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have a weekly work meeting\\nwith your colleague\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The purpose of the pilot study is two-fold: we evaluate\\nour proposed procedure and test whether the methods that we plan to use can\\nyield good results. More specifically, firstly we get feedback from the subjects\\non our proposed relationship features - results suggest that subjects have a high\\nlevel of agreement with our proposed features. Secondly, we test whether we can\\nuse these features to predict the priority of different situations using decision\\ntrees - results show this is indeed the case, which means our proposed knowledge\\nstructure can be used to infer meaning about situations. The accuracy of the\\npredictions will be tested in a full fledged study. The usage of pilot studies to\\nevaluate both procedures and methods is customary in medical research [27].\\n\\nThe rest of the paper is structured as following: Section 2 gives relevant\\nbackground information. In Section 3, we discuss related work and position our\\napproach. Section 4 introduces our proposed knowledge structure and offers a\\nformalisation of the features needed to model the social environment. In Section\\n5, we present our pilot experiment and discuss the results. Section 6 shows how\\nwe can use decision trees to predict priorities of events based on data from\\nsubjects. Section 7 concludes the paper.\\n\\n2 Background\\n\\nThe theoretical foundations of our approach are based on one hand on social\\nsciences literature related to situations and social relations, and on the other\\nhand on the concept of decision trees as a reasoning tool. These concepts are in-\\ntroduced in the following subsections. The reviewed literature is non-exhaustive,\\nand we do not aim at providing a comprehensive overview of the fields. We focus\\non literature related to daily life situations and aspects of social relations which\\nare relevant for these situations.\\n\\n\\n\\nModelling Social Situations 3\\n\\n2.1 Features of the Situation\\n\\nRauthmann and colleagues [24] propose that features of situations can be dis-\\ncussed in three different levels: cues, which are physical and objective elements\\n(who is present, what activity is taking place, etc.), psychological characteris-\\ntics, which are dimensions that can be used to describe situations (such as duty,\\nintellect, etc.), as well as classes, which are abstract types of situations (such\\nas social situations, work situations, etc.). For the scope of this work, we will\\nfocus on situation cues and classes, since these are concrete concepts that can be\\nelicited from the user. Psychological characteristics, and how to automatically\\ninfer them, will be explored in future work.\\n\\nRauthmann et al. [24] divide situation cues in three categories: persons,\\nevents/activities, and locations. Saucier et al. [26] identify similar categories\\nin an experiment in which students describe their daily situations, namely lo-\\ncations, associations (i.e. people/interactions), as well as actions and positions.\\n[23] focuses instead on building situation classes based on reports from subjects.\\nMost of the subjects\\xe2\\x80\\x99 daily situations were clustered as work situations, family\\nsituations, friends/recreation situations and private recreation situations.\\n\\n2.2 Features of Social Relationships\\n\\nSocial relations can be studied from different points of view, and in this section\\nwe review literature which considers numerous aspects of relationships. Based on\\nthis, we will select the features of social relationships that need to be modelled.\\n\\nKahn and Antonucci [17] explore the role of social relations as a form of\\nsupport for (elderly) people. The support system is conceptualized as a Convoy\\nmodel - three concentric circles representing three levels of closeness. Different\\naspects of the relationship are considered in order to establish someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s posi-\\ntion within the convoy model, such as: quality (e.g., positive, negative), contact\\nfrequency (e.g., irregular, yearly, monthly, etc.), geographic proximity (e.g., closer\\nor more far than a 1 hour driving), range (number of life domains included in\\nthe interaction), etc. [17, 2].\\n\\nSocial relations are also considered from the organizational point of view.\\nMainela [20] gives an overview of types and functions of social relationships\\nthat can be relevant in the organization of a joint venture. For example, Gra-\\nnovetter [15, 14] talk about strong ties and weak ties in work relationships. The\\nstrength of a tie in a network depends on the amount of time spent on it, the\\nemotional intensity, the intimacy, and the reciprocity. Furthermore, the author\\nargues that ties are stronger when the level of acquaintance is deeper. In a sim-\\nilar manner, Uzzi [29] talks about arm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-length ties and embedded ties. The\\nformer, similarly to weak ties, lack reciprocity and repeatedness, and concern\\nnarrow economic matters. The latter are characterized by trust, reciprocity, ex-\\nchange of tacit knowledge, etc. Coleman [8] and Ring and Van de Ven [25] talk\\nabout role relationships and personal relationships. Lastly, another feature of\\nsocial relationships in an organizational context the hierarchy level between the\\nindividuals [30].\\n\\n\\n\\n4 Kola et al.\\n\\n2.3 Reasoning about Situations\\n\\nIn order to evaluate whether our proposed knowledge structure can be useful in\\npractice, we will explore how to use its elements in order to reason about the\\npriority level of situations. Different strategies can be used to reason about the\\npriority of an event. The most straightforward approach would be to combine\\nthe situation cues in an Expected Priority (EP) function, such as:\\n\\nEP =\\n\\xe2\\x88\\x91\\nc\\xe2\\x88\\x88C\\n\\nwcvc\\n\\nwhere C is the set of all cues considered, and where for all c \\xe2\\x88\\x88 C, vc refers to the\\ncue value and wc to the relative weight of cue c in this computation. However,\\nthere are two main issues with this approach. First of all, most of the cues\\nthat we are dealing with have nominal values, so quantifying them is difficult.\\nFurthermore, based on the literature on preference profiles, see e.g., [4], in many\\ndecision situations, we hypothesize the weight values to be dependent on the\\nindividual, making the correct initialization of the weight values a challenge.\\n\\nAnother option is to use decision trees (e.g., [5]). Literature suggests that\\nthe structure of decision trees is appropriate for reasoning about social rela-\\ntions. First of all, cognitive psychology proposes that social intelligence can have\\na modular nature [13]. This means different \\xe2\\x80\\x9cscripts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are activated in different\\nsettings. People recognize these settings from environmental cues, and in turn\\ndecide to behave in a certain way. This is similar to the concept of decision trees,\\nin which different combinations of cues lead to different decisions. Endsley also\\nsuggests that people use different \\xe2\\x80\\x9cschemata\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to organize and combine knowl-\\nedge and perceptions in order to comprehend the situation [10]. An additional\\nargument in their favour is that the decision process of decision trees is pre-\\ndictable and transparent. This would allow the agent to explain to the user why\\na certain priority level is assigned to a specific event.\\n\\nDecision trees are graphical representations of a set of rules which can be used\\nto make classifications. Each node of the tree represents a question regarding\\ncertain features of the object that is being classified, and each branch represents\\na different answer to that question. Nodes below a given node either contain\\nanother question, or are given a label which assigns a class to the object. The\\nlatter are called leaf-nodes. Given an object with a set of features and a decision\\ntree, in order to classify the object we traverse the tree until we reach a leaf. The\\nquestion remains how to build decision trees which accurately classify data. A\\ncommon approach is to learn the tree models based on a set of data, and then\\nuse it to classify new instances. One of the most used methods because of its\\nhigh accuracy is the Classification and Regression Trees algorithm (CART ) [5].\\n\\nCART models are binary trees, which means for every parent node there are\\ntwo child nodes. Learning a CART model involves selecting features and split\\npoints on those features until a suitable tree is constructed. This selection is\\nperformed by using a greedy algorithm which minimizes a cost function. For\\nclassification tasks, CART uses the Gini index as a cost function. This measure\\nis an indication of how \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the nodes are (i.e., how mixed the training data\\n\\n\\n\\nModelling Social Situations 5\\n\\nassigned to each node is). The Gini index for a set of objects with N classes,\\nsuppose i \\xe2\\x88\\x88 {1, 2, . . . , N}, is computed as:\\n\\nG =\\n\\nN\\xe2\\x88\\x91\\ni=1\\n\\npi(1\\xe2\\x88\\x92 pi)\\n\\nwhere G is the Gini index over all classes and pi is the proportion of objects\\nwhich are part class i. A node in which all objects are of the same class (perfect\\npurity) would have G = 0. For every node, CART selects features that maximize\\nthe purity of the split. The procedure continues until a certain stopping criterion.\\n\\n3 Related Work\\n\\nContext and situations are well studied concepts in computer science. In this sec-\\ntion, we introduce approaches that have been used to model arbitrary situations\\nfrom peoples\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lives, and position our work in relation to them.\\n\\nKokar and colleagues [18] present a formalization of situations based on the\\nsituation theory developed by Barwise [3] and extended by Devlin [9]. This for-\\nmalization is compatible with the interpretation of situation awareness in terms\\nof human awareness provided by Endsley [11]. According to the assumption by\\nBarwise [3], situations are simply limited parts of the world perceived by peo-\\nple. The main elements of situation theory are objects and types. Some of the\\nbasic types are IND, representing the type of individuals, RELn, representing n-\\nplace relations, SIT, representing the types of situations, etc. The basic informa-\\ntion about a situation is expressed by infons, written as: <<R,a1,...,an,0/1>>\\nwhere R is an arbitrary n-place relation, a1, ..., an are objects appropriate for R,\\nand 0/1 is the polarity of the infon, showing whether the relation holds for those\\nobjects or not. For instance, the infon <<chases, dog, cat, 1>> would express\\nthat the relation chases(dog, cat) holds. Kola and colleagues [19] provide an\\nextension of this ontology with relations that support modelling social relation-\\nships. We believe that explicitly modelling people and relations is something\\nuseful, and we share the view that situations should be modelled from the point\\nof view of the user. However, the way relations are modelled is very abstract.\\nThis can be problematic when modelling situations from peoples\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lives, therefore\\nwe believe that a more structured approach is needed. This is the approach we\\nare taking in our two-level ontology.\\n\\nYau and Liu [31] also offer an ontological approach that models situations for\\npervasive computing applications. They differentiate between situations, defined\\nas \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca set of contexts in the application over a period of time that affects future\\nsystem behavior\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and contexts, defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cany instantaneous, detectable, and\\nrelevant property of the environment, system, or users\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Their ontology is based\\non this division, and they specify a context layer, which models context definition\\nand contextual data, and a situation layer which is built on top of the context\\nlayer and aggregates context into situations. This forms the core of their upper\\nontology, whereas the elements of the lower ontology can be specified depending\\n\\n\\n\\n6 Kola et al.\\n\\non the domain. This approach does not fundamentally differ from ours, and their\\ndefinition of context seems similar to our definition of situation cues. However,\\nsimilar to Kokar et al. [18], this approach is very abstract and building the lower\\nlevel domain specific ontologies is not a trivial task. The only example provided\\nin the work models a very specific situation (ReadyForMeeting) and does not\\nprovide general elements that need to be represented for the domain as a whole.\\nIn our work we provide these elements for the domain of social situations.\\n\\nZavala and colleagues [32] offer a framework which can be used to build\\nplace-aware mobile applications. To do so, they build a place ontology which\\nmodels the concept of place not only as a geographical location, but also in\\nterms of activities that occur there. For instance, someone can have an office in\\ntwo different cities, but both of them would count as a work place since similar\\nactivities occur there. In Murukannaiah et al. [21], this approach is extended and\\nsocial circles are learned based on the places that people are met (following the\\nprevious example, people met in workplaces would be classified as colleagues).\\nTheir approach goes beyond modelling very abstract concepts, which we believe\\nis crucial for building applications that can be used by people. However, the\\nconcept of places is just one aspect of situations and does not cover the full\\npicture. Our approach fills this gap.\\n\\nWe believe these approaches form a good starting point for modelling situa-\\ntions. Our work is inspired by the first two when it comes to the overall structure\\nand the subjective point of view, and by the third one when it comes to the ex-\\nplicit and structured way in which concepts are modelled. In the following, we\\nwill combine these concepts in order to form an explicit and practical knowledge\\nstructure for modelling social situations.\\n\\n4 A Knowledge Structure for Social Situations\\n\\nA social situation can be described in different ways, based on the domain that\\nis being modelled. For this reason we will use an ontology which consists of an\\nupper and a lower level [16], where the upper level contains concepts which can\\nbe used to characterize arbitrary social situations, and the lower level describes\\nmore specific features which can be domain-, or context dependent. For the upper\\nlevel, we start by defining a social situation:\\n\\nDefinition 1 (Social Situation). A social situation s \\xe2\\x88\\x88 S, where S refers to the\\nset of situations, is defined as:\\n\\ns = \\xe3\\x80\\x88People, Cues\\xe3\\x80\\x89\\n\\nCues are elements of the social situation that need to be represented. These\\nconcepts will be formally defined in the next subsection. People stand in spe-\\ncific social relationships. In this work we focus on dyadic relationships, and thus\\nconcern ourselves with social situations involving two people. In some literature\\npeople are also considered as situation cues. We decide to consider them sepa-\\nrately since their presence in a situation and their social relationships are the\\ncore aspects which make a situation social.\\n\\n\\n\\nModelling Social Situations 7\\n\\nFig. 1: Upper ontology of dyadic social situations.\\n\\nFigure 1 offers a schematic representation of the knowledge structure. As\\ndepicted in the figure, a dyadic relationship can have two arbitrary people in\\nit. In our case, one of the people will be the user who is being supported. The\\ndistinction is made because the situation is seen from the point of view of the\\nuser, and in future work we will model different features from the user than from\\nthe other person.\\n\\nIn the following subsections, we introduce the elements of a lower ontology\\nwhich can be used to model daily life social situations. We provide an informal\\ndescription and a definition of the situation cues, as well as the features of the\\ndyadic relationships. In the following, situations are seen as events or meetings.\\nD refers to a set containing the value-ranges for the cues we define. The set A\\nrefers to the identifiers of the human actors that are part of a social situation\\n(referred to as people in Figure 1). Note that our pilot experiment should also\\ninform us on the appropriateness of the value-ranges we associate with cues and\\nfeatures. Depending on the reactions of our subjects in the pilot experiment, we\\nmight change these ranges to other indicators.\\n\\n4.1 Situation Cues\\n\\nThe literature on situation taxonomies provides a large set of situation cues that\\ncan be used to describe situations. We cluster them in the following definition:\\n\\nDefinition 2 (Situation Cues). The set of cues involves the following concepts:\\n\\nCues = {setting, location, activity, frequency, time}\\n\\n\\n\\n8 Kola et al.\\n\\nHowever, for the scope of this work, we limit ourselves on modeling the\\nsetting and frequency of the event, and leave modelling locations and activities\\nfor future work. A good starting point can be the work of Zavala et al [32].\\n\\nThe concept of a situation setting describes in which context a certain event\\nis taking place, and is inspired by the concept of situation classes, as defined in\\nSection 2.1. The setting can give insight into which psychological characteristics\\nare relevant for the specific situation. The activities are user-dependent and\\ntherefore, the range of activities we present includes the most common situation\\nclasses that the users face in their daily life. Note that this range might need to\\nextended for a specific user. In this example, we base the range of activities on\\nPervin [23]. The situation cues proposed in Rauthmann et al. [24] can also be\\nclustered into these settings.\\n\\nDefinition 3 (Situation Setting). is a relation defined by:\\n\\nsetting : S \\xc3\\x97 Dsetting where Dsetting = {work related, casual meeting,\\nsports activity, family related}\\n\\nEvent frequency refers to the frequency with which the event takes place. This\\nvariable is not explicitly mentioned as a situation cue in the literature, however\\nsome situation taxonomies (e.g., [22]) suggest typicality as one of the psycho-\\nlogical characteristics of the situation. From our pilot experiment we see that\\nfrequency can help determine how typical a situation is.\\n\\nDefinition 4 (Event Frequency). is a relation defined by:\\n\\nevent freq : S \\xc3\\x97 Defreq where Defreq = {regular, occasional}\\n\\nIn some cases, it is important to know who initiated a meeting, since it can make\\nthe user feel more obligated to attend it. We formally define it as:\\n\\nDefinition 5 (Event Initiator). is a relation defined by:\\n\\nevent init : S \\xc3\\x97 Dinit where Dinit = A \\xe2\\x88\\xaa {none}\\n\\n4.2 Features of Dyadic Relationships for Daily Life Situations\\n\\nIn this section we introduce the key features of dyadic relationships that a be-\\nhaviour support agent can use to model daily life social situations of a user.\\nThe sets of features are part of the lower ontology, and can (and should) be\\nadapted to the domain of use. Therefore, the list presented in this section is\\nnot exhaustive, but serves as an example and was used to model the scenar-\\nios in our pilot experiment. We distinguish between a long term feature set of\\nproperties of social relationships that do not have to be adapted for each situ-\\nation, and a situation specific feature set of features that do change per situation.\\n\\nNote that the range of some features is Likert5, which denotes a 5-point\\nLikert-type scale, where 1 is the lowest/most negative value and 5 the high-\\nest/most positive value. The information is subjective, from the point of view of\\n\\n\\n\\nModelling Social Situations 9\\n\\nour user.\\n\\nLong Term Feature Set\\nThe first feature is the quality of the relation between the two actors, and is also\\none of the features used in the convoy model [1].\\n\\nDefinition 6 (Quality of the Relation). is a relation defined by:\\n\\nrel quality : A\\xc3\\x97A\\xc3\\x97Dquality where Dquality = Likert5\\n\\nThe feature role refers to the role of the second actor towards the first actor\\nin dyadic relations. Knowing how the user (first actor) is related to the other\\nperson (second actor) is important since it can help inferring the expectations\\nthat come with the role. The range of roles is taken from the general social\\nsurvey [6].\\n\\nDefinition 7 (Role). is a relation defined by:\\n\\nrole : A\\xc3\\x97A\\xc3\\x97Drole where Drole = {partner, parent, sibling, child,\\nextended family, coworker, neighbor, friend, supervisor,\\n\\ngroup member, other}\\n\\nHierarchy level refers to the power dynamics between the first and second actor.\\nHigher (respectively same and lower) means that the second actor is higher up\\n(resp. at the same level, and lower) in the hierarchy than the first actor. In case\\nthere is no hierarchy amongst actors, this is indicated by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cn.a.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The feature\\nhierarchy is relevant when assessing the priority of meetings, especially for users\\nwho are in working relations, or actors that come from a culture with some sort\\nof caste system. More information on the concept of hierarchical ranking can be\\nfound in, e.g., [12, 30].\\n\\nDefinition 8 (Hierarchy). is a relation defined by:\\n\\nhierarchy : A\\xc3\\x97A\\xc3\\x97Dhierarchy where\\nDhierarchy = {higher, same, lower, n.a.}\\n\\nThe next feature is the frequency of contact between the two actors. The degree\\nof interaction can help assessing the closeness of people, and also the importance\\nof a specific situation [1, 2].\\n\\nDefinition 9 (Frequency of Contact). is a relation defined by:\\n\\nrel cfreq : A\\xc3\\x97A\\xc3\\x97Dcfreq where Dcfreq = Likert5\\n\\nLevel of Trust in the relationship refers to the level of trust that the first actor\\nhas towards the second actor. The amount of trust can complement information\\non the quality of the relation. Level of Trust is mentioned as feature in [29].\\n\\nDefinition 10 (Level of Trust). is a relation defined by:\\n\\nrel trust : A\\xc3\\x97A\\xc3\\x97Dtrust where Dtrust = Likert5\\n\\n\\n\\n10 Kola et al.\\n\\nDepth of Acquaintance is a feature of the first actor towards the second actor.\\nThis feature can play a similar role to the level of trust, or in general inform on\\nthe expectations that actors have from the relationship. This feature is mentioned\\nby Granovetter [14].\\n\\nDefinition 11 (Depth of Acquaintance). is a relation defined by:\\n\\nacq depth : A\\xc3\\x97A\\xc3\\x97Dacq where Dacq = Likert5\\nThe default geographical distance refers to the physical proximity of the two\\nactors. It can influence the relationship of two people since it affects how often\\nthey can see each other. This feature is mentioned by Antonucci and Akiyama\\n[2]. For the range we opted to measure distance in terms of time that it usually\\ntakes to get to that person.\\n\\nDefinition 12 (Default Geographical Distance). is a relation defined by:\\n\\ndef geo dist : A\\xc3\\x97A\\xc3\\x97Dgeo where\\nDgeo = {0-1hr, 1-2hr, 2-4hr, flight needed}\\n\\nThe last feature refers to the Level of Formality in the relationship. This feature\\ncan inform on the expectations of the relationship, and is mentioned by Ring\\nand Van de Ven [25].\\n\\nDefinition 13 (Level of Formality). is a relation defined by:\\n\\nrel formal : A\\xc3\\x97A\\xc3\\x97Dformal where Dformal = Likert5\\nSituation Specific Feature Set\\nThe first two features to consider are situation specific roles and hierarchy levels.\\nThey become relevant when in the specific situation they differ from the default\\nones. For instance, if you go to a basketball game with your boss, in that situation\\nyou are both team-mates, and if you are the captain you are the one holding a\\nhigher hierarchy level in that situation. The variables are defined in the same way\\nas the default ones, although the specific situation is also part of the definition:\\n\\nDefinition 14 (Situated Role and Situated Hierarchy). are relations defined\\nby:\\n\\nrolesit : S \\xc3\\x97A\\xc3\\x97A\\xc3\\x97Drole\\nhierarchysit : S \\xc3\\x97A\\xc3\\x97A\\xc3\\x97Dhierarchy\\n\\nThe feature help dynamic refers to whether in the specific event the first actor\\nis giving or receiving help from the second one. The fact that they have to give\\nor receive help can influence how obligated the actors feel to attend a certain\\nevent. It is formally defined as:\\n\\nDefinition 15 (Help Dynamic). is a relation defined by\\n\\nhelp dynam : S \\xc3\\x97A\\xc3\\x97A\\xc3\\x97Dhelp, where\\nDhelp = {giving, receiving, neither}\\n\\nThe situation cues and relation features form the core of a user-specific user\\nstudy, in which we test their perceived relevance.\\n\\n\\n\\nModelling Social Situations 11\\n\\n5 User Study\\n\\nIn order to evaluate how well our knowledge structure is able to model realistic\\nsituations, we conducted a pilot experiment in which subjects had to answer to\\na survey. In the following sections we will introduce the experimental setting, as\\nwell as present and discuss the results.\\n\\n5.1 Experimental Setting\\n\\nPilot Subjects\\nWe tested 20 subjects (15 male, 5 female) who answered to all three parts of the\\nexperiment. Subjects were university employees (mostly PhD candidates). The\\naverage age was 31.1 years old (SD=7.6yo).\\n\\nDesign and Procedure1\\n\\nThe experiment was implemented as an online survey, and consisted of three\\nparts. In the first part, subjects were asked to think about six people from their\\nsocial circle. For the purpose of the study, they were instructed to select at\\nleast one family member, one friend, and one person who had a higher hierarchy\\nlevel than them. Note that, in the full experiment, we will ensure we also get\\ninformation on relationships with people lower in the hierarchy. For each of these\\npeople, subjects were asked about all long term features (Section 4.2). The first\\npart was concluded with an evaluation section in which the subjects were asked\\nwhether the questions were understandable, whether the amount of questions\\nwas appropriate, and whether they thought the questions represent their social\\nrelationship with someone. Furthermore, they had the option to propose more\\naspects of social relationships which they thought are relevant.\\n\\nIn the second part, subjects were shown with 20 social dyadic scenarios of\\ndaily life. Each scenario involved one of the six people that they had mentioned in\\npart 1, selected randomly2. We made the study subject-specific to enable them to\\nreflect on their own relationships, instead of presenting them with hypothetical\\nrelationships. Scenarios consisted of different parameters of the situation cues\\nand situation specific features of social relationships. A scenario could represent\\na social situation such as: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have invited Person X for a work meeting on\\nTuesday morning because you need some feedback on your recent project\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. In\\nthis case it is a work setting, the event is occasional, the subject is the initiator\\nand he/she is expected to receive help.\\n\\nFor each scenario, subjects were asked about the priority of the meeting, how\\nobligated they would feel to attend the meeting and how much they would enjoy\\nit. Furthermore, they were asked how they think the other person would answer\\nthese questions. Lastly, they were asked about the likelihood of that scenario\\n\\n1 The questions for each part of the experiment can be found in the Appendix.\\n2 Apart from the scenarios in which a family setting or a higher hierarchy work setting\\n\\nwere being tested, which were restricted to family members and people with higher\\nhierarchy, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\n12 Kola et al.\\n\\nhappening in their daily life. Subjects had to answer on a 5-point Likert scale.\\nIn order to assess priority, they were instructed to take into account how difficult\\nit would be for them to cancel the meeting, how important they think it is to\\nbe punctual, and any other thing they would consider relevant.\\n\\nIn the third and last part, scenarios were paired randomly and subjects were\\nasked which of the two meetings would they choose to attend in case of a conflict\\nbetween the two scenarios. Furthermore, they were asked what reason would they\\ngive to the person whose meeting they were canceling: the real reason, some other\\nreason, or no reason. Each subject was presented with six pairs of scenarios.\\n\\n5.2 Results and Discussion\\n\\nIn this subsection, we will present and discuss the results of each part of the\\npilot experiment separately.\\nPart 1\\nThe selected people from the subjects\\xe2\\x80\\x99 social circle had an average age of 37.6\\nyears old (SD=13.55yo). They were mostly friends (29%), followed by people\\nfrom work (18% supervisors and 10% coworkers) and family members (11%\\nparents, 8% siblings and 7% members of the extended family). Partners consisted\\nof 10% of the selected people. Overall 74% of the people were not in a hierarchical\\nrelation with the subjects, 22% were on a higher level and 4% on a lower level.\\n36% lived within an hour of distance from the subjects, 18% between 1-2 hours,\\n4% between 2-4 hours, and for the remaining 32%, the subjects would need to\\ntake a flight in order to meet them. Subjects mostly chose people with whom\\nthey have strongly positive relationships (average of 4.15, with 82% being a 4 or\\n5). Furthermore, they chose people whom they trust (average of 4.13, SD=0.88)\\nand the relationships have a low level of formality (average of 1.81, SD=1.11).\\nIn the full experiment, in order to have more representative data from a larger\\nvariety of relationships, we will control some features when asking the subjects\\nto think of people from their social circle. For instance, we will ask some subjects\\nto think about a coworker with whom they do not have a positive relationship.\\n\\nThe evaluation questions (all posed with a 5-point Likert scale in possible\\nanswers) showed that the subjects found the questionnaire understandable, with\\nan average of 4.59 (SD=0.51). The number of asked questions was appropriate\\n(the average answer was 3, SD=0.61, on a 5-point scale where 3=appropriate).\\nWhen asked how much this information represents their relationship with some-\\none (Likert range from 1 = very little to 5 = very much), the average answer\\nwas 3 (SD=0.79), confirming that social relationships have subtle aspects not\\ncaptured in our questionnaire. Whether we need to add more features, depends\\non the strength of the correlations between the current features and the choices\\nthe subjects make in Part 2 of the questionnaire. The subjects (mostly being\\nPhD students), seemed to understand this point, as some subjects indicated\\nthat the answer to this question depends on the purpose of the study. This is\\nsomething that we will take into account in future experiments.\\n\\nWhen asked whether they could think of additional aspects of social rela-\\ntionships which should be present in the survey, 35% of subjects answered with\\n\\n\\n\\nModelling Social Situations 13\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Some of the suggestions included: dependability, understanding, fun, re-\\nspect, how important is the other person, common interests, etc. However, none\\nof the suggestions appeared consistently. In the full experiment we plan to keep\\nthis open question to see whether we can see patterns in the suggestions.\\n\\nThe value-ranges of the relationship features were appropriate for our test\\ngroup. We received no indications to the contrary from our subjects.\\n\\nPart 2\\nIn this section subjects were asked to evaluate different scenarios. Table 2 presents\\nthe average results.\\n\\nSubject Other person\\n\\nPriority 4.11 (SD=0.86) 3.87 (SD=0.91)\\n\\nObligation 3.67 (SD=1.08) 3.54 (SD=1.04)\\n\\nEnjoyment 3.76 (SD=1.02) 3.88 (SD=0.86)\\n\\nTable 1: Average answers for Part 2 scenarios. The column Subject indicates the average\\nanswers given by the subject, while Other person indicates what answers would the\\nother person give to that scenario, according to the subject.\\n\\nSubjects mostly assign a high priority to the meetings. This was expected\\ngiven that scenarios included people with whom the subjects have a close and\\npositive relationship. This is also reflected in how much they enjoy these meet-\\nings. The average likelihood of the scenarios was 3.14 (SD=1.42), which means\\nthe scenarios were relatively likely despite being chosen randomly. We notice a\\nhigh standard deviation, caused by the fact that some of the scenarios had a low\\nlikelihood, possibly because of the random person-meeting combination.\\n\\nSubjects seem to consider a high level of reciprocity when thinking about the\\nlevel of priority/enjoyment/obligation from their and the other person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s point\\nof view. This is shown by the moderately strong positive correlations (0.63 for\\npriority, 0.63 for obligation and 0.71 for enjoyment). For the full experiment we\\nwill consider social relationship features related to reciprocity.\\n\\nNext, we check the correlations between priority, obligation and enjoyment\\nfrom the subjects\\xe2\\x80\\x99 perspective. Our expectation was that priority would have a\\npositive correlation with obligation and enjoyment, while obligation and enjoy-\\nment would not be correlated with each other.\\n\\nVariables Overall correlation\\nCorrelation in\\ncasual setting\\n\\nCorrelation in meeting with\\nsomeone with higher hierarchy\\n\\nPriority-Obligation 0.496 0.45 0.77\\n\\nPriority-Enjoyment 0.41 0.64 0.33\\n\\nObligation-Enjoyment 0.01 0.18 0.18\\n\\nTable 2: Correlation between different variables.\\n\\nAs expected, priority has a moderately strong positive correlation with obli-\\ngation and a moderate positive correlation with enjoyment. Obligation and en-\\n\\n\\n\\n14 Kola et al.\\n\\njoyment do not correlate. Interestingly, priority has a stronger correlation with\\nenjoyment in situations with a casual setting (e.g., going out for drinks). On the\\nother hand, it correlates with obligation in meetings with someone who has a\\nhigher hierarchy or in work meetings. This suggests that obligation and enjoy-\\nment are two aspects that are considered when deciding on the priority, and that\\ntheir respective impact depends on the situation type. In future work the full\\nexperiment is expected to make the strength of these correlations more precise.\\n\\nPart 3\\nIn this part, subjects were given pairs of scenarios (from part 2), and they had\\nto select which one they would attend if they could attend only one. We notice\\nthat in 69% of the cases, subjects would select the meeting to which they had\\nassigned a higher priority in part 2. This suggests that priority is a good indicator\\nof how people break ties. However, it is not the only thing. We noticed that in\\nmost of the cases in which subjects select meetings to which they had assigned\\na lower priority, those meetings have also a low likelihood. This suggests that\\nwhen breaking ties between different meetings, subjects also take into account\\nhow difficult would be to reschedule each of the meeting. Also, in this section we\\nsee differences between individuals, since there were subjects who consistently\\nchose a certain type of meetings. This can link to the subjects\\xe2\\x80\\x99 personal values.\\n\\nSubjects were also asked about the justification that they would give to the\\nperson whose meeting they would cancel. In 89% of the cases, subjects reported\\nthat they would give the real reason. Most of the cases in which the subjects\\nwould give no reason or a different reason (and not the real one) took place when\\nthey chose to attend meetings with a lower priority. Furthermore, many cases\\ninvolve either not reporting to someone with a higher rank, or not giving details\\nabout their meetings with family members.\\n\\n6 Predicting Priority of Events with Decision Trees\\n\\nRepresenting elements of the environment is useful, however these features need\\nto be combined before conclusions can be drawn about how people evaluate\\nsituations. In Situation Awareness literature, this process is called comprehension\\n[11]. In this work we explore one general and abstract characteristic of a given\\nsituation, namely its priority. This can be considered a first step towards having\\nsufficient information about situations and offer support.\\n\\nAs a method to reason about meeting priorities, we use decision trees. We\\nbuild the model using the R package rpart [28], which implements the CART\\nalgorithm [5] introduced in Section 2.3. We use 70% of the data as a training set\\nfrom which the tree structure was learned, and then test it on the remaining 30%.\\nAs a pruning mechanism we limit the maximal depth of the tree to 4. Since we\\nlack a benchmark in this domain, we compare our result with an algorithm which\\nwould predict a random priority (as we offered 5-point scale, chance corresponds\\nto 20%) and with an algorithm which always picks the most selected class (i.e.\\npriority 4, which was selected in 41% of cases). To determine the accuracy of the\\n\\n\\n\\nModelling Social Situations 15\\n\\nmodels, we use the following definition:\\n\\naccuracy =\\nNumber correct predictions\\n\\nNumber overall predictions\\n\\nOur model has a 47% accuracy on the test set, performing better than the\\nother two algorithms that we used as a benchmark. This means we are able to\\npredict priority of a particular event better than chance. This result is important,\\nespecially when we consider that:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 This is a first benchmark result in this domain, it proves that predicting\\npriority based on elements of the situation is possible, and it opens the path\\nto exploring different techniques;\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 We built the model using a small data set, and learning algorithms need\\nmore data in order to generalize better. This is also shown by the high level\\nof over-fitting which takes place, as noticed by the fact that the accuracy on\\nthe training set is 65%;\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 The data is unbalanced, since people mostly give a priority of 4 or 5 to events.\\nThe presence of lower priorities would make the evaluation of the algorithm\\nmore realistic since we would be able to measure not only the number of\\ncorrect predictions, but also how far off the incorrect predictions are. The\\nlow variance in the data can be explained by the fact that subjects chose\\npeople who are very close to them, thus they would prioritize those events.\\n\\nIn the model, we notice that the most informative features are: role, rela-\\ntionship quality, event setting and meeting initiator. This means these features\\noffered the highest information gain throughout the tree. The actual model that\\nwas learned is depicted in Figure 2.\\n\\nFig. 2: Decision tree built based on the data. Nodes with categorical features, such as\\nevent setting, should be interpreted as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis event setting=casual OR sport?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n16 Kola et al.\\n\\nWe remark that, to us, many of the tree splits are intuitive. For instance, the\\nfirst information that is checked is the setting of the meeting, with casual and\\nsport events on one hand and family and work events on the other. This split\\nwas to be expected since subjects assigned higher priorities to family and work\\nevents. Methodologically, our pilot experiment also shows that we can use the\\nfull fledged experiment to obtain an informed decision tree. How accurate that\\nwill be is, of course, still remains to be seen.\\n\\n7 Conclusions\\n\\nFor the benefit of the development of behaviour support agents with social sit-\\nuation awareness, this paper provides the following contributions:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 a conceptualization and formalization of a knowledge structure that repre-\\nsents the salient situation cues and features of dyadic social relationships.\\nThe knowledge is based on theoretical work from social psychology, and or-\\nganized as a two-level ontology.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 an evaluation of this knowledge structure via a pilot experiment. Results\\nshow that subjects find the concepts understandable and representative.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 testing whether our idea of learning decision trees to predict the priority of\\nevents is feasible in practice, which proved to be the case.\\n\\nThis provides the foundations needed for building socially aware behaviour\\nsupport agents. Now we have the elements that need to be modelled as well as\\nwe show that it is possible to reason about these elements and infer meaning.\\nThis opens the way for many research options, which we present below.\\n\\nBased on the findings reported in this paper, a full fledged experiment can\\nbe confidently carried out to obtain a detailed social model that can serve as\\na background model for behaviour support agent to advice on how to choose\\nbetween social situations. This can be achieved by deriving norms about the\\npriority of situations, which can be learned from subjects\\xe2\\x80\\x99 data.\\n\\nAnother interesting approach is to analyze how personal values affect the\\nway in which subjects think about social situations. Part three of our pilot\\nexperiment suggested the existence of individual differences in how people decide\\nwhich meetings to attend. We will explore whether people with shared personal\\nvalues make similar choices.\\n\\nThe current model relies fully on information that is acquired directly from\\nthe users. In future work, we would like to add sensory data to inform our model.\\nLiterature shows that sensory data can be used to perceive social information\\n(e.g., [7]). This line of research would provide useful ways to acquire information\\nwithout interrupting the user.\\n\\nFinally, in this work we mostly focus on modelling social situations. The next\\nstep is to dive deeper into situation comprehension, and reason about different\\ndimensions of the situation (other than priority). This would lead to having a\\nmore complete profile of the situation, which in turn enables behaviour support\\nagents provide more comprehensive help.\\n\\n\\n\\nModelling Social Situations 17\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.
