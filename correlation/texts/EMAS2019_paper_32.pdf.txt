Multiagent Systems (MAS) research reached a maturity to be con-\\nfidently applied to real-life complex problems. Successful application of MAS\\nmethods for behavior modeling, strategic reasoning, and decentralized gover-\\nnance, encouraged us to focus on applicability of MAS techniques in a class of\\nindustrial systems and to elaborate on potentials and challenges for method inte-\\ngration/contextualization. We direct attention towards a form of industrial prac-\\ntices called Industrial Symbiosis Systems (ISS) as a highly dynamic domain of\\napplication for MAS techniques. In ISS, firms aim to reduce their material and\\nenergy footprint by circulating reusable resources among the members. To enable\\nsystematic reasoning about ISS behavior and support firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (as well as ISS de-\\nsigners\\xe2\\x80\\x99) decisions, we see the opportunity for marrying industrial engineering\\nwith engineering multiagent systems. This enables introducing (1) representa-\\ntion frameworks to reason about dynamics of ISS, (2) operational semantics to\\ndevelop computational models for ISS, and (3) coordination mechanisms to en-\\nforce desirable ISS behaviors. We argue for applicability and expressiveness of\\nresource-bounded formalisms and norm-aware mechanisms for the design and\\ndeployment of ISS practices. In this proposal, we elaborate on different dimen-\\nsions of ISS, present a methodological foundation for ISS development, and fi-\\nnally discuss open problems.\\n\\nKeywords: Multiagent Systems Application \\xc2\\xb7 Resource-Bounded Systems \\xc2\\xb7 In-\\ndustrial Symbiosis \\xc2\\xb7 Normative Semantics \\xc2\\xb7 Coordination and Control\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nAs a response to recent environmental concerns on reducing the exploitation and dis-\\ncharge of (pure) resources, the idea to circulate reusable resources (also known as the\\npractice of circular economy [21]) gained attention in both academia as well as indus-\\ntry. Industrial Symbiosis Systems (ISS) are green/waste-free implementations of the\\nconcept of circular economy in the context of industrial relations [9, 35]. For instance,\\na cluster of firms A, B, and C may have the chance to reuse each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wastes. E.g.,\\nA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s excess steam can be used in B\\xe2\\x80\\x99s turbines, B\\xe2\\x80\\x99s waste water can be used for cooling\\nin C, and C\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sludge can substitute a primary input of A. Exploiting such an opportu-\\nnity may lead to financial as well as socio-ecological gains. As ISS is merely focused\\n\\nlouisedennis\\nPlaced Image\\n\\n\\n\\n2 V. Yazdanpanah et al.\\n\\non circulating non-commoditized resources, e.g., waste material and energy, waiting\\nfor traditional market structures to materialize and successfully implement ISS would\\nbe a guaranteed failure3. Thus, ISS have to be well-designed to be sustainable and in\\nsome cases its stability requires the introduction of external monetary incentives [38].\\nAs Eric Maskin says: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe market is no god\\xe2\\x80\\x94it cannot solve every problem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. This con-\\ntribution calls for engineering market places for ISS to address four main dimensions\\nof such systems [9]: temporal evolution, strategic aspects, resource boundedness, and\\nnormativity.\\nTemporal Evolution (TE): Since ISS builds upon potentially long-term industrial syn-\\nergies, it is not similar to single-shot industrial transactions but has a temporal dimen-\\nsion. The preference on establishing long-term relations is mainly due to presence of\\nadditional costs (such as transportation, treatment, and transaction costs) for imple-\\nmenting ISS. Roughly speaking, firms prefer to implement a relation that lasts\\xe2\\x80\\x94aiming\\nto avoid renegotiating new relations for each and every transfer of reusable resources.\\nMoreover, ISS operates within the temporally dynamic industrial context (with respect\\nto costs, demands, and supply). Thus, engineering attempts to ensure ISS strength, sta-\\nbility, and fairness have to take into account the dynamicity of such systems over time.\\nStrategic Aspects (SA): The initiation and stability of relations in ISS critically de-\\npends on the dynamics of power and firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 strategic abilities. In principle, firms act\\nwith respect to their preferences and strategic potentials\\xe2\\x80\\x94which in turn defines their\\npotential for success4 and their so-called strategic responsibility [36]. Dismissing this\\naspect leads to (agent-based) models that represent all firms in the same (power) level\\nand abstract from the reality of industrial organizations. This call for game forms able\\nto capture the dynamics of power, executable plans/strategies, and firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 potential out-\\ncomes (i.e., to specify and analyze \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat strategy ensures what situation for what group\\nof firms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nResource Boundedness (RB): In ISS, the implementability of relations is bounded\\nto physical (i.e., to be circulated) as well as financial (i.e., to be obtained/invested)\\nresources. Basically, firms have to take into account whether their short-term deci-\\nsions/actions and long-term plans/strategies are in-line with their available resources.\\nTo capture this, a natural approach would be to model ISS using modeling structures\\nrooted in resource-bounded logics [4].\\nNormativity and Coordination (NC): In brief, normativity of ISS refers to the ar-\\ngument that: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot all forms and potential implementations of industrial symbiosis are\\nenvironmentally/socio-economically desirable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. In Section 2.2, we elaborate on this ar-\\ngument and motivate the need for tailoring coordination mechanisms to nudge the be-\\nhavior of ISS towards collectively desirable ones5.\\n\\n3 In a more concrete sense, given an environmentally desirable collaboration among A, B, and\\nC, the allocation of collectively obtained benefits could be problematic in case any firm (group)\\ncan gain more by defecting the ISS. In the game-theoretical language, given an empty core of\\nthe coalitional game, guaranteeing the stability of the collaboration requires external incentives\\n(see [38]), hence calls for contextualized methods for incentive engineering in ISS.\\n\\n4 See [26] for the interrelations between preferences, power, and success.\\n5 As we elaborate later, resource-bounded formalisms capture TE, SA, and RB but we lack\\n\\nframeworks able to integrate NC as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Introduction to Engineering Multiagent ISS: Potentials and Challenges 3\\n\\nThe literature on industrial symbiosis is rich in addressing case-specific issues.\\nHowever, we see that focusing on implementing specific cases results in hardly gen-\\neralizable solution concepts. E.g., focusing on single-shot 1-1 relations dismisses the\\ntemporal as well as strategic (coalition-formation) dynamics in ISS. We observe the\\nlack of generic methods\\xe2\\x80\\x94able to capture the above mentioned dimensions (i.e., TE,\\nSA, RB, and NC)\\xe2\\x80\\x94for designing and coordinating ISS. In principle, ISS is a highly\\ndynamic MAS, as it demonstrates normative and strategic dynamics in a temporal and\\nresource-bounded context.\\n\\nTo address these dimensions, we follow the idea that the formal representation of\\nmulti-stakeholder systems [16, 18] enables systematic reasoning about their evolution\\nand fosters coordinating their complex behavior. This motivates the need for introducing\\na new line of scientific inquiry on multiagent models for industrial symbiosis systems.\\nIn the following, we elaborate on main requirements for engineering such systems and\\npropose a methodological foundation for it. We also discuss that this domain of mul-\\ntiagent systems application calls for integrating some (not yet integrated) multiagent\\nformalisms.\\n\\n2 A Normative Multiagent Approach\\n\\nWe present a methodological foundation to enable modeling ISS and specifying its tem-\\nporal, resource-bounded, and strategic aspects. Building on this, we discuss the norma-\\ntivity of industrial symbiosis and motivate the need for employing norm-aware coordi-\\nnation mechanisms.\\n\\n2.1 Modeling ISS\\n\\nWe see ISS as a multiagent system in which each agent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s action \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsumes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d resources\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\neither financially, physically, or both. A rich method for representing and reasoning\\nabout such systems is Resource-Bounded Alternating-time Temporal Logic (RB-ATL)\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nintroduced in [4]. Building on an adopted version of the semantic machinery of RB-\\nATL, an ISS can be modeled as a Resource-Bounded Concurrent Game Structure (RB\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nCGS[4])M = (N,Res,Q,Act, d, c, o) where: N = {a1, ... , an} is the set of n firms\\ninvolved in ISS; Res = {res1, . . . , resr} is a set of r resource types; Q is a non-empty\\nset of states;Act is a non-empty set of actions; d : Q\\xc3\\x97N 7\\xe2\\x86\\x92 P(Act)\\\\{\\xe2\\x88\\x85} is a function\\nthat in each state q \\xe2\\x88\\x88 Q, assigns a non-empty set of actions d(q, a) \\xe2\\x8a\\x86 Act to each firm\\na \\xe2\\x88\\x88 N (by D(q), we denote the set of all joint actions \\xcf\\x83 = (\\xce\\xb11, . . . , \\xce\\xb1n) such that\\n\\xce\\xb1i \\xe2\\x88\\x88 d(q, ai)); partial function c : Q\\xc3\\x97N\\xc3\\x97Act 7\\xe2\\x86\\x92 Nr maps a state q \\xe2\\x88\\x88 Q, firm a \\xe2\\x88\\x88 N ,\\nand an action \\xce\\xb1 \\xe2\\x88\\x88 d(q, a) to a vector of integers, where a positive integer in position\\ni indicates the consumption of resi \\xe2\\x88\\x88 Res by action a; and o : Q \\xc3\\x97 D(q) 7\\xe2\\x86\\x92 Q is\\na deterministic transition function\\xe2\\x80\\x94modeling the evolution of the ISS\\xe2\\x80\\x94that for each\\nstate q \\xe2\\x88\\x88 Q and joint action \\xcf\\x83 \\xe2\\x88\\x88 D(q), returns a state that results from the execution of\\n\\xcf\\x83 in q.\\n\\nIn our suggested formalization, Res may consist of both financial as well as phys-\\nical resources. Specifying such a set of consumable resources, modeling their con-\\nsumption using the cost function c, and combining these two with ATL-based transi-\\ntion systems enables modeling the real-life behavior of ISS as industrial organizations\\n\\n\\n\\n4 V. Yazdanpanah et al.\\n\\n[32]. Such a modeling framework is flexible with respect to the set of available actions\\n(Act), that the ISS designer intends to consider in its model. For instance, one may\\nlimit Act to physical actions (e.g., sending or recycling some quantity of a resource),\\nconsider communicative actions [15] (e.g., informing another agent and updating its\\nbelief-/knowledge-base), or specify a more complex mix of institutional and physical\\nacts [12] (e.g., offering/accepting a deal or sending/receiving a resource). Note that the\\nuse of RB\\xe2\\x80\\x93CGS enables relying on computationally attractive algorithms for verifying\\ntemporal, resource-bounded, and strategic properties [5]. Following the successful use\\nof RB\\xe2\\x80\\x93CGS and related resource-aware action models to specify real-world systems\\n[2], we propose contextualizing RB\\xe2\\x80\\x93CGS for ISS modeling and its integration with\\nnorm-aware techniques for ISS coordination.\\n\\n2.2 Normativity of ISS\\n\\nUsing this representation, one can reason about the evolution of an ISS (temporarily)\\nin which firms are able to execute their decisional plans (strategic) that are bounded to\\nconsumable resources (resource-boundedness). We argue that the autonomy of firms,\\nthe availability of resources, and the evolution of ISS raise the concern that we may see\\nundesirable situations.\\n\\nIn principle\\xe2\\x80\\x94from the perspective of the ISS designer/engineer\\xe2\\x80\\x94an ISS may go to\\nan (un)desirable state, a firm may execute an (un)desirable action, or in a more complex\\nlevel, an ISS may perform an (un)desirable behavior. This is, to ascribe normative labels\\nto states, actions, and behaviors.\\n\\nState Normativity: In an ISS, the modeler can represent potential implementations\\nof a relation in states. For instance, firms may either implement a fair benefit allocation\\n(represented by state qf ) or otherwise occurs (represented by state qu). Then, the system\\ndesigner can aim for suppressing unfair relations by ascribing undesirability to qu and\\naccordingly implement normative mechanisms to coordinate the behavior of ISS.\\n\\nAction Normativity: In addition to the above-mentioned state normativity, the execu-\\ntion of some actions (in some specific states) can also be bad/good. For example, the act\\nof transporting a hazardous resource or defecting from an unfulfilled commitment (i.e.,\\nwhen the promise is not yet satisfied) can both be seen undesirable. More generally, a\\nsubset of available actions (to an agent in a state) can be labeled as undesirable.\\n\\nBehavior Normativity: Specifying state and action normativity is not sufficient to ex-\\npress some more complex undesirabilities (e.g., those that are concerned with the order\\nof execution of some actions). In principle, the semantic notion of system\\xe2\\x80\\x99s normative\\nbehavior is about the desirability of a chain of actions/events/states. For instance, even\\nif neither sending an offer, receiving an offer, nor accepting the offer are bad actions,\\ntheir execution in a wrong order can be an undesirable system behavior (e.g., the chain\\nof events in which a firm first accepts an offer and then receives it can be an undesirable\\none). Note that ISS is designed to bring about a stable and resilient practice of circular\\neconomy, hence has to be aware of\\xe2\\x80\\x94and able to control\\xe2\\x80\\x94such normative situations.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Introduction to Engineering Multiagent ISS: Potentials and Challenges 5\\n\\n2.3 ISS Behavior and Normative Semantics\\n\\nFirst, we show how our suggested modeling structure enables specifying the ISS behav-\\nior as well as its normativity.\\n\\nDefinition 1 (ISS Behavior). Given an ISSM, we denote the set of infinite sequences\\nof states by Q\\xcf\\x89 . A sequence \\xce\\xbb = q0, q1, . . . \\xe2\\x88\\x88 Q\\xcf\\x89 is an ISS behavior iff for all tuples\\nof states (qi, qi+1), there exist a \\xcf\\x83 \\xe2\\x88\\x88 D(qi) such that o(qi, \\xcf\\x83) = qi+1. The set of all\\npossible behaviors ofM is denoted by \\xce\\x9bM (\\xce\\x9b ifM is clear from the context).\\n\\nWhile in some cases, specifying the normativity of states/actions is sufficient, the\\nsemantically rich notion of behavior normativity enables reasoning about and coordi-\\nnating the more complex behavioral aspect of ISS.\\n\\nDefinition 2 (ISS Behavioral Norm, Compliance, Violation). A norm N is a subset\\nof ISS behaviors \\xce\\x9b (i.e., N \\xe2\\x8a\\x86 \\xce\\x9b). An ISS behavior \\xce\\xbb complies with N (for short, \\xce\\xbb is\\nN -compliant) iff \\xce\\xbb \\xe2\\x88\\x88 N . Otherwise, \\xce\\xbb violates N (for short, \\xce\\xbb is N -violation).\\n\\nAlthough the subject of norm synthesis/evolution in ISS is important, in this pro-\\nposal we assume norms to be given and fixed. Such norms can be either derived using\\ndata-driven methods or defined from the perspective of a third-party/legislative agent6.\\n\\nObservation 1 (Expressivity) Specifying ISS behaviors (using RB\\xe2\\x80\\x93CGS) is also ex-\\npressive for modeling state and action normativity. State normativity can be derived\\nusing a single-state ISS behavior while action normativity can be modeled based on a\\ntwo-state ISS behavior and the action profile that connects the two.\\n\\nGiven a formal representation of ISS, one may ask whether verifying normative\\npropositions\\xe2\\x80\\x94e.g., the compliance of the ISS behavior to a given norm\\xe2\\x80\\x94are computa-\\ntionally feasible. Relying on well-established results of [4], we have that Given an ISS\\nM, verifying the validity of (normative) propositions has the computational complexity\\nof O(`2|Res|+1 \\xc3\\x97 |M|) where ` is the size of the formula.\\n\\nWe presented a methodological foundation, rooted in the semantic machinery of\\nRB\\xe2\\x80\\x93CGS, for representing and reasoning about ISS behavior. Next, we propose that for\\nmaintaining the ISS behavior\\xe2\\x80\\x94within an acceptable spectrum\\xe2\\x80\\x94norm-based coordina-\\ntion mechanisms are applicable and appropriate system engineering tools.\\n\\n2.4 Coordinating ISS\\n\\nWhile normativity refers to the property of ISS (behavior) to be desirable or unde-\\nsirable, normative coordination mechanisms are mainly methods for flexible adminis-\\ntration to keep the system (behavior) within an acceptable spectrum. Operationalizing\\nnorms and employing norm-based instruments to ensure desirable system behaviors is\\n\\n6 One may construct a norm considering the consumption of resources (e.g., if a behavior is\\nin-line with available resources in Res), may model a norm to specify performable behaviors\\nunder a budget limit (e.g., if aggregating all the costs\\xe2\\x80\\x94modeled by the c function\\xe2\\x80\\x94is under a\\nthreshold), or may combine the two to formulate more complex norms.\\n\\n\\n\\n6 V. Yazdanpanah et al.\\n\\na well-established principle in multiagent systems research. This includes proposals on\\napplicability of normative coordination methods as a tool for operating electronic in-\\nstitutions [1], for monitoring commitments in multiagent organizations [12], and for\\nimplementing protocols in norm-governed networks [6, 37].\\n\\nRelying on this literature and considering the normative characteristics of ISS, we\\nsuggest the following \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormative regimentation-/sanction-/reparation-based coordina-\\ntion toolbox\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94as a basis for contextualized coordination mechanisms\\xe2\\x80\\x94to ensure the\\nnormatively desirable behavior in ISS, i.e., to enforce norm compliant ISS behaviors.\\nIn each part, we present the intuition and briefly elaborate on how the method can be\\nimplemented in the RB\\xe2\\x80\\x93CGS settings.\\nRegimentation-Based Approach: The main idea behind regimentation, as a tool for\\nenforcing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood\\xe2\\x80\\x9d behaviors, is to implement a mechanism that guarantees the pre-\\nvention of all the norm-violating behaviors. In RB\\xe2\\x80\\x93CGS setting, regimentation can be\\nimplemented by updating the transition system (in specific, by implementing a norm-\\nsupervisor function that updates the d function) and forbidding actions that may result\\nin a bad ISS behavior. As elaborated in [11], ensuring that all the bad behaviors are\\navoided may result in avoiding some good behaviors as well. Although this is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctight\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nform of coordination, it is applicable for engineering critical ISS (e.g., for implementing\\nindustrial symbiosis on nuclear wastes, where no degree of violation is acceptable). But\\nin a more flexible ISS\\xe2\\x80\\x94and considering the sensitivity of industrial domain to restric-\\ntive administration methods\\xe2\\x80\\x94we suggest coordination mechanisms of a more \\xe2\\x80\\x9crelax\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nnature: sanction-/reparation-based methods.\\nSanction-Based Approach: In sanction-based methods, the idea is to enforce good\\nbehaviors by making bad behaviors more costly7. I.e., bad behaviors may happen but\\nthe aim is to nudge the behavior towards good one. In RB\\xe2\\x80\\x93CGS representation of ISS,\\nsanctions can be implemented by updating the cost function c (e.g., by increasing the ac-\\ncumulated cost of actions, included in a norm-violating behavior). An alternative would\\nbe to impose sanctions on firms that are able to avoid bad behaviors (i.e., sanctioning\\nwith respect to strategic potentials) or by applying preference-aware mechanisms[8].\\nReparation-Based Approach: In general, the reparation-based approach gives the op-\\nportunity to the firms to \\xe2\\x80\\x9crepair\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a norm-violating behavior\\xe2\\x80\\x94e.g., by postponing the\\nsanction imposition. In ISS coordination, this is to expect that firms will return/recover\\nthe system to norm-compliant behavior as they tend to avoid being imposed with a\\nsanction. To implement this, one may extend the set of norm-compliant ISS behaviors\\nby including repaired behaviors. For instance, the designer may tolerate any norm vio-\\nlating behavior \\xce\\xbbv only if it is immediately followed by state qr, where visiting qr is the\\nresult of (collectively) paying a compensation value cv (lower than the sanction value\\nsv). Thus, if the involved firms immediately pay cv after a violation \\xce\\xbbv , they ensure that\\nthe behavior is repaired, hence will not be sanctioned. To fine-tune cv and to determine\\nthe number of steps that imposing a sanction can be postponed are relevant concerns\\nfor refining ISS coordination mechanisms.\\n\\n7 In general, norm-aware sanctioning refers to the imposition of penalties/taxes when the be-\\nhavior is undesirable. However, it can be also employed for introducing negative sanctions, in\\nterms of rewards/subsidies, to encourage desirable behaviors [27].\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Introduction to Engineering Multiagent ISS: Potentials and Challenges 7\\n\\n3 Open Problems and Engineering Challenges\\n\\nAs motivated earlier, we call for scientific investigation on multiagent models for in-\\ndustrial symbiosis systems. Below, we elaborate on some open problems in this new\\ndomain of study and highlight the relation to relevant multiagent techniques.\\nTransaction Cost Economics: One of the main advantages of implementing well-\\ndesigned ISS\\xe2\\x80\\x94in contrast to traditional ad-hoc industrial symbiosis relations\\xe2\\x80\\x94is to\\nreduce the total transaction cost. This can be achieved using automatized smart con-\\ntracts, and in turn by eliminating the searching and negotiation costs. In principle, such\\ndynamics of transaction cost affect the stability and fairness of cost/benefit allocation\\nmechanisms. We believe that this gap can be captured building on the line of contri-\\nbution on cost of stability [25, 7] and by developing dynamic allocation methods, in\\ncontrast to approaches that take a static characteristic function as given.\\nIncentive Engineering: To support the implementation of an ISS\\xe2\\x80\\x94with the aim to\\nguarantee its resilience and stability\\xe2\\x80\\x94legislative bodies may introduce external sup-\\nport in terms of monetary incentives. This is either by providing subsidies to support\\nsocio-environmentally desirable ISS implementations or by imposing taxes to suppress\\nundesirable practices. To have a successful allocation of incentives, we lack policy-\\nsupport tools, aware of the structure and dynamics of ISS. To tackle this, we see that\\ninvolved firms can be modeled as resource-controllers in an ISS game. This approach\\nenables the applicability of incentive engineering methods for ensuring properties in\\nboolean games [34].\\nGovernance: In an ISS, firms will get involved in commitments (in the institutional\\nlevel) and can affect the state of resources (in the physical level). To be able to specify,\\nmonitor, and maintain a well-behaving ISS, we need multiagent commitment gover-\\nnance frameworks and interorganizational communication protocols. Following [30],\\nwe see norms as a basis for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadministration of stakeholders by stakeholders\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and for\\noffering coordination as a service [17] in ISS. While we elaborated on norm-based coor-\\ndination approaches, specifying ISS communication languages, identifying their prop-\\nerties, and developing norm-based governance platforms for ISS are still open prob-\\nlems. Moreover, ISS are expected to be long-term and to evolve over time. Then to cap-\\nture their dynamicity and accordingly updating the governance models, participation\\nand feedback of industrial symbiosis practitioners are among the key requirements. For\\nsuch a purpose, integrating participatory policy analysis models [24] with norm-aware\\nmodels [31, 20, 3] would be a suggested direction.\\nOrganizational Characterization: For design and coordination of ISS, a critical point\\nis to understand, model, and reason about the dynamics of roles, relationships, and au-\\nthority structures. E.g., in some forms of ISS the role of facilitating firms (i.e., broker\\nagents) is crucial while in some, resource recycling plants play a key role. In our pro-\\nposed ISS model, we simply reason about action-based dynamics of ISS, thus abstract\\nfrom organizational structures and notions such as roles, obligations, permissions, and\\nprohibitions. However, in multiplex ISS scenarios, it is more natural to introduce high-\\nlevel organizational notions (1) for capturing the complex dynamics of ISS and (2) for\\ncoordinating its behavior accordingly. This is to move from \\xe2\\x80\\x9c ISS as a multiagent sys-\\ntem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cISS as a multiagent organization\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. To this end, one may develop a mapping\\nbetween multiagent organizational paradigms [18] and different forms of ISS. This calls\\n\\n\\n\\n8 V. Yazdanpanah et al.\\n\\nfor identifying the set of roles in various forms of ISS\\xe2\\x80\\x94with respect to firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 control on\\nresources and their strategic position\\xe2\\x80\\x94and accordingly verifying the appropriateness of\\norganizational structures. For instance, while hierarchical structures seem applicable for\\nmaterial-based ISS (due to geographical proximity of firms in an industrial cluster), a\\ncoalition-based structure might be appropriate for service-based ISS (due to involve-\\nment of potentially distant clusters).\\nSocial Aspects, Trust, and Openness: While an ISS designer provides a secure plat-\\nform (to nurture stable relations), the stability of relations also depends of the dynam-\\nics of trust and firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 socially-bounded autonomy\\xe2\\x80\\x94in the sense of [10]. Note that in\\nISS, we are dealing with (semi)autonomous firm managers who act with respect to\\n(not only) the economic analysis on obtainable benefits (but also) the set of subjective\\npreferences\\xe2\\x80\\x94that may be affected by social practices or trust dynamics [13]. Thus, cap-\\nturing agents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 preferences and trust in reasoning about the behavior of ISS would be an\\ninteresting attempt for applying available trust formalizations [33, 29, 19] in a practical\\ndomain. A practical way forward would be to capture firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 subjective preferences\\xe2\\x80\\x94on\\nthe list of potential symbiotic coalitions\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and employ it as a filtering measure on the\\nfeasibility of economically profitable instances [39]. Finally, while most frameworks\\nfor modeling organizations focus on a closed system, there is a lack of open multia-\\ngent models to specify ISS8. Following [28, 14], we believe that allowing the ability to\\nleave/join an ISS (as an industrial institution) calls for a new form of dynamic stabil-\\nity/resilience analysis. For such a purpose, one may employ financial incentives [23],\\nuse social bounds [19], or apply expectation-aware methods [22].\\n\\n4 Concluding Remarks\\n\\nWe presented a normative multiagent perspective on engineering (ISS). This includes:\\n(1) a formal specification that enables modeling the temporal, strategic, and resource-\\nbounded characteristics of ISS, (2) operational semantics to develop computational\\nmodels for such systems, and (3) the sketch of mechanisms for ensuring desirable sit-\\nuations in ISS. We also showed the expressiveness of resource-bounded semantics for\\npractical applications and elaborated on how RB\\xe2\\x80\\x93CGS can be combined with norm-\\nbased coordination mechanisms. We deem that the successful application of multiagent-\\nbased methods requires taking into account the dynamics of the application domain\\nand fine-tuning the methods to develop fit-for-purpose technologies. Our contribution\\nis the first attempt in proposing norm-aware resource-bounded multiagent frameworks\\nfor specifying ISS, verifying its normative behavior, and coordinating it towards desir-\\nable outcomes. As an immediate extension, we aim to work on logical characterization\\nof the presented concepts and to pursue their pilot deployment in industrial clusters.\\n\\nAcknowledgement: The first two authors acknowledge the received funding from Eu-\\nropean Union\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Horizon 2020 programme under grant agreement No. 680843.\\n\\n8 Formal modeling of open MAS is still an open problem.
